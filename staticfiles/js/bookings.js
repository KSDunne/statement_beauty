// JS script with event listeners for deleting a makeover booking
// Credit: https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/blog/blob/main/12_views_part_3/05_edit_delete/static/js/comments.js
// Note: A defensive design was built in to the delete funtion with a modal

// constants for delete event listener
//const deleteModal = new bootstrap.Modal(document.getElementById("deleteModal"));
//const deleteButtons = document.querySelectorAll(".btn-delete");
//const deleteConfirm = document.getElementById("deleteConfirm");

// here is the code which enables the deletion modal functionality
// this prompts the user to confirm they really want to delete a booking
// credit: https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/blog/blob/main/12_views_part_3/05_edit_delete/static/js/comments.js
// code was adapted for my own use where 'comment' was used originally, 'booking' is used here
//for (let button of deleteButtons) {
 // button.addEventListener("click", (e) => {
  //  let bookingId = e.target.getAttribute("data-booking_id");
  //  deleteConfirm.href = `delete_booking/${bookingId}`;
  //  deleteModal.show();
 // });
//}
